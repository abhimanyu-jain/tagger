Data exploration:
	Get frequency count for each word in terms of how many userprofiles it is connected to.
	Can be used as an auxillary dictionary?


for each skill:
	remove useless whitespace
	remove anything except alphabets. if there are symbols or numbers in the middle of 2 characters, it's garbage
	remove articles, conjunctions, prepositions, adjectives

	// TODO: if skill has too many words, maybe we can filter it out?

	for every word in the skill:
		check if it exists in the dict = spellchecker + auxillary.
		if all words exist in dict, skill is validated

		otherwise
		replace words with result from dict (1 edit distance for less than 4 letter words, otherwise edit distance of 2)
		if no such options, mark it as garbage
		if skill doesn't have a single noun in it, it's garbage

	store every skill with a replacement. if even 1 word is garbage, whole skill is marked 'garbage'

	//TODO: Handle cases where spellings are there in spellchecker but it's not a valid skill?
